# RAH

**RAH** is a python-made pixel **autoclicker** program. Primarily made for humanbenchmark, it can now be used for any purpose.

# New Features!

  - Choose the **rgb** color to trigger a click event when your cursor meets the choosed color (**default is 99,219,100**).
  - Choose the clicking speed ranging from 0 to 1, *the closer to 0, the faster the clicking will be* (**default is 0.50**).
  - Option to open an rgb website and to create a log.txt file in the download directory, *best used for debugging, can slow down clicking time!*.

### Installation
Before installing make sure you have the latest version of [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) first.

To then run it simply download the executable in the **dist folder** and launch it or run it *manually* with:

```sh
$ python app.py
```
### Tips
For fast clicking put a speed value of around `0.005-0.0005` and for the best results disable `log.txt` file creation.
