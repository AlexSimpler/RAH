# New Features!

  - Choose the **rgb** colors of your pixel then leave the mouse on it and it will trigger a click event on color change.
  - Choose the clicking speed(not fully optimized yet).
  - Now creates a log.txt file in your download directory that contains the clicking and it's execution time which can be used for debugging.

### Installation
Before installing make sure you have the latest version of [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) first.

To then run it simply download the executable and launch it or run it *manually* with:

```sh

```
